Import shares in sector $j$,
\[
(d_{nmt}^{j})^{1/\theta} = \frac 1 {\xi B^j}
	\kappa_{nmt}^j
	P_{nt}^j A_{mt}^j (T_m^j)^{1/\theta}
	(w_{mt}^j)^{-\beta^j}
	\prod_{k=1}^J
		(P_{mt}^k)^{-\gamma^{kj}}
\]
in logs, and taking all observables to the LHS,
\[
\frac 1\theta \ln d_{nmt}^{j}
+ \ln(\xi B^j)
-\ln \kappa_{nmt}^j
	=
	\ln P_{nt}^j +\ln A_{mt}^j 
	+ \frac1\theta \ln T_m^j
	-\beta^j\ln w_{mt}^j
	-\sum_{k=1}^J
		\gamma^{kj}\ln P_{mt}^k
\]
Stack the different $j$s into a column vector,
\[
\frac 1\theta \ln \mathbf d_{nmt}
+ \ln(\xi \mathbf B)
-\ln \boldsymbol \kappa_{nmt}
	=
	\ln \mathbf P_{nt} +\ln \mathbf A_{mt} 
	+ \frac1\theta \ln \mathbf T_m
	-\boldsymbol\beta \circ \ln \mathbf w_{mt}
	-\boldsymbol\Gamma \ln \mathbf P_{mt}
\]
Given our estimates on $\kappa$, the LHS is observable. The first term of the RHS is the only $nt$-specific unobservable, everything else is $mt$-specific. Subtract the same equation for $n=0$ (the US),
\[
\frac 1\theta 
	(\ln \mathbf d_{nmt}-\ln \mathbf d_{0mt})
	- (\ln \boldsymbol \kappa_{nmt} - \ln \boldsymbol \kappa_{0mt})
	=
	\ln \mathbf P_{nt} -  \ln \mathbf P_{0t}.
\]
Given measured prices in the US, this gives us an estimate for all sectoral prices in all countries. We then have an estimate of $\boldsymbol\Gamma \ln \mathbf P_{mt}$, the only new term among $mt$-unobservables. We can then proceed as before.
