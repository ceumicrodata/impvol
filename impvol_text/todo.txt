For Miklos
- check formulas for labourrel
- add io/deficit formulas to all eq conditions
- add io/deficit calibration 

For Peter
- Tables 1-3 as before (IO and S)
- Table A1: no imbalances
- Table A2: no I-O linkages
- change Matlab outer loop: new updating rule as in labourrel.pdf
	- new global parameter set in initialize, c.labor_adjustment_cost=1
	- new global parameter c.rho = 1/25?
	- in https://github.com/ceumicrodata/impvol/blob/unbalanced-trade/equilibrium/equilibrium_algorithm.m change the updated labor allocation after line 127, adjust by percentage wage gap / rho
	- create new initialize.m, change lines 41 and 42 to save new results
- new section "Robustness": Tables sames as 1-3 but with labor adjustment costs

For Silvana
- work on response
